Errors Fixed:

1. Missing #include <iomanip> for fixed and setprecision.


2. Incorrect return type in main() (changed from float to int).


3. Missing variable declarations for i and j in loops.


4. Incorrect logical expression: average = 100 OR average =< 300 changed to average == 100 || average <= 300.


5. Missing return 0; at end of main.



Let me know if you want these highlighted in a side-by-side comparison.
